  # class nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocatorGL

  Derived from nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator it uses vulkan memory that is exported
  and directly imported into OpenGL. Requires GL_EXT_memory_object.

  Used just like the original class however a new function to get the 
  GL memory object exists: `getAllocationGL`.

  Look at source of nvvk::AllocatorDmaGL for usage.
